    <h2>Java Based Projects</h2>

    <p>
      At Tech Elevator I studied Java and used it for the capstone projects we had throughout
      the cohort
    </p>

    <h3>Favorite Projects</h3>

    <p>
      There are two projects that I am particulary proud of, my first MVC application and
      the final capstone from Tech Elevator.
    </p>
